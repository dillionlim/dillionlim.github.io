# Day 6: Guard Gallivant

## Input Bounds

From preliminary data analysis, the guard will start in the `^` position. All other characters will be `.` or `#`. The movement of the guard is guaranteed to terminate for part A.

## Part A

### Abridged Problem Statement

Given a grid, where `.` represents empty space and `#` represents an obstacle, and `^` represents the initial position of the guard, find the total number of unique cells that the guard will cross before it exits the boundary of the grid. The guard will turn clockwise on encountering an obstacle.

### Solution

Find the initial coordinates of the guard, and simulate the movement of the guard. Record cells that the guards has already crossed to avoid double counting.

### Code Complexity

**Time Complexity:** $O(M \times N)$

* $M$ is the number of rows in the grid.
* $N$ is the number of columns in the grid.

We iterate through each cell to simulate the movement of the guard.

**Additional Space Complexity:** $O(M \times N)$

The grid is also used for storing the visited cells of the guard.

**Final answer:**

## Part B

### Abridged Problem Statement

Given a grid, where `.` represents empty space and `#` represents an obstacle, and `^` represents the initial position of the guard, find the total number of unique cells that the guard will cross before it exits the boundary of the grid. The guard will turn clockwise on encountering an obstacle.

Find the number of cells where placing a `#` will cause the guard to walk in a loop.

### Solution (Old)

First, we observe that placing obstacles on any cell that is not on the original guard's path (in part A) will not lead to a loop.

So, we only need to test whether placing obstacles on a given cell on the original guard's path will lead to a loop. For this, we can use a hash set to maintain the set of `(x, y, direction)` at every turn, and there exists a loop if we encounter the same set of `(x, y, direction)` again.

As an improvement, one can hash the coordinates into a single integer, and use a bitmask to represent the direction of the current represented. That is, the value of the `direction_index`-th bit will represent whether that direction has been visited. We can then reuse the vector that is functioning as our hash set to avoid reconstruction costs.

### Solution (Optimized)

Instead of manually walking through every square to find a loop, we note that the critical points are simply the points where we make a turn. Therefore, we can precompute a jump map to find the next point where we have to turn.

For a tile $(x, y)$, we can precompute the next position to jump to for each of the 4 directions. This can be done by a line sweep in the opposite direction of the jump. For example, for the downwards direction, we start at the bottom of the grid, and record all tiles to jump to the bottom of the grid (out of bounds). When we encounter an obstacle, we set all future tiles to jump to the tile above this obstacle, and repeat until we have completed sweeping in this direction. We then repeat for all 4 directions.

Now, when we attempt to find a loop, we simply jump to the next obstacle position. However, we note that we are going to be placing down dynamic obstacles, since we will be testing if every position on our path will lead to a loop. The dynamic obstacles only affect our jump map position if:

* If we are jumping left or right, it has the same row index as us, and is to the left or right of us respectively.
* If we are jumping upwards or downwards, it has the same column index as us, and is to the top or bottom of us respectively.

If we are jumping left or upwards, and are affected by the dynamic obstacles, we want to find the **maximum** index between the current jump map coordinates and the dynamic obstacle. Conversely, if we are jumping right or downwards, and are affected by the dynamic obstacles, we want to find the **minimum** index between the current jump map coordinates and the dynamic obstacle.

By using this jump map, it brings down the runtime from over 5 seconds to approximately 200 ms, a 50 times speedup!

### Code Complexity

**Time Complexity:** $O(M^2 \times N^2)$

* $M$ is the number of rows in the grid.
* $N$ is the number of columns in the grid.

We iterate through each cell to simulate the movement of the guard. For each cell on the path of the guard, in the worst case, we need to jump through the entire grid again to determine if it causes a loop.

**Additional Space Complexity:** $O(M \times N)$

The hashmap can store up to all the cells, in the worst case scenario. 

**Final answer:** 1723.
